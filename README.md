Key findings: 

Bioregional analysis, dynamic time warping-based clustering, and ensemble construction effectively assess temporal and spatial variations in Worldclim CMIP6 GCMs and SSPs against historical data in Ecuador's varied geography.
16 of 26 GCMs indicated precipitation increases in bioregions like the Chocó, Amazon, and the Equatorial Pacific Coast, while the rest showed decreases, principally in the Amazon and Andes. These patterns extend to countries such as Colombia and Perú, which share these bioregions. 
Discrepancies in GCMs for the Andes and Galapagos reveal the challenges of complex topographies and insular environments, while the 20-year WorldClim averages made it infeasible to analyze the relationship with ENSO events, underscoring the need to refine precipitation projections.
Tailoring GCMs and SSPs selection to specific bioregional and sectoral needs for effective assessments of precipitation climate change impacts is recommended.
